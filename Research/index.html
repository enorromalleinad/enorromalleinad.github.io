									This project is focused on resolving exoplanets along stellar streams using synthetic images from the in-development 
									<a href="https://www.twinkle-spacemission.co.uk/">Twinkle Space Satellite</a>. Working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~webb/home.html">Professor Jeremy Webb</a>, Daniella will 
									create the simulated Twinkle images of planetary systems orbiting around host stars that 
									are embedded with stellar streams. The goal of the project is to determine whether 
									or not the planetary systems can be detected in Twinkle images using the transit method and if their atmospheres 
									can be studied spectroscopically.

						<h2>Identifying Astrometric Exoplanet Candidates in Gaia Data Release 3.</h2>
						<h4>Trottier Summer Internship at the Institute for Research on Exoplanets (May - August 2022)</h4>
						<p>During the summer of 2022, Daniella worked jointly at the 
							<a href="http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/?lang=en" target="_blank">Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx)</a>
							at the Université de Montréal and 
							<a href="https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/mobile/planetarium-rio-tinto-alcan" target="_blank">Planétarium Rio Tinto Alcan</a> 
							under the supervision of 
							<a href="https://jgagneastro.com/" target="_blank">Professor Jonathan Gagné</a>.
							This project primarily focused on the identification of astrometric exoplanet candidates 
							in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). Sorting and filtering many properties of stars in the data, 
							Daniella identified 284 candidate exoplanet host stars, 34 of which are young stars that were then sent for direct imaging.
							<br><br>
							During this internship, Daniella was given the opportunity to visit the 
							<a href="http://omm.craq-astro.ca/" target="_blank">Observatoire Mont Mégantic</a> 
							twice. On the first visit, 
							the observatory technician guided Daniella and two other inters on how to use the telescopes and software (PESTO and CPAPIR). 
							On the second visit, Daniella instructed two other interns on these instruments.
							<br><br>
							Deliverables for this work included a final presentation to all iREx members. A RNAAS is currently being written for this work.

								<p style="font-size:16px;">In a continuation of the work done in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP),

									<a href="https://kartheikiyer.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Kartheik Iyer</a>
									and spanned from September 2021 to April 2022.
									For this thesis, Daniella used the pipeline that was developped in summer 2021 to measure the morphology of galaxies
									in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). Measuring the half-light and half-mass radii - that is, 
									the circular apertures containing half the image's flux - of galaxies reveals characteristics of 
									morphological poperties such as stellar mass and specific star formation rate. These measurements were 
									found for the XDF galaxies which were larger than 100 pixels on the field and had redshift 0.5 &lt z &lt 6. 
									This work is vital to understanding and predicting both galaxy morphology and evolution.

						<h2>What does morphology tell us? Understanding galaxy evolution through the lens of galaxy shapes and sizes.</h2>
						<h4>Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the University of Toronto (May - August 2021)</h4>
						
						<p>During the summer of 2021, Daniella had the opportunity to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) 
							in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. 
							Under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lamiyamowla.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Lamiya Mowla</a> and 
							<a href="https://kartheikiyer.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Kartheik Iyer</a>, Daniella developped a pipeline to analyze 
							morphological characteristics of galaxies in simulations and observations. This pipeline, written in Python coding language, 
							uses packages such as <a href="https://statmorph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">statmorph</a> (Rodriguez-Gomez et al., 2019) and 
							<a href="https://github.com/tbmiller-astro/imcascade">imcascade</a> (Miller & van Dokkum, 2021) to fit galaxies and measure 
							physical properties. During development and after completion, this pipeline was applied to SIMBA simulated galaxies and 
							corresponding mock observation images of these simulations.
							<br><br>
							During this program, Daniella was given the opportunity to attend a professional development presentation series and
							an introduction to astrophysics research lecture series (Astro 101). Further, Daniella also audited an Introduction to 
							Computational Astrophysics course (CTA200H).
							<br><br>
							Deliverables for this work included a <a href="https://surpatuoftastro.github.io/posters/Daniella_Morrone.pdf">poster presentation</a> 
							and a <a href="https://surpatuoftastro.github.io/research-summaries/daniella-morrone-research-summary.pdf">research summary</a>.

						<h2>Behavioural and Pathological Characterization of Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease in the TgF344-AD rat model.</h2>

								<p style="font-size:16px;">
									During the summer of 2019, Daniella worked in the laboratory of 
									<a href="https://lmp.utoronto.ca/faculty/joanne-mclaurin">Dr. JoAnne McLaurin</a> at <a href="https://sunnybrook.ca/research/">Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI)</a>. 
									The project was centered around the behavioural and palothogical characterization of prodromal Alzheimer's Disease in the TgF344-AD rat model at 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of age.
									</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						
						<p>
						The behavioural characterization work to which Daniella contributed was analzying pre-recorded Barnes maze trials and classifying the behaviour 
						according to the spatial strategies detailed in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw376">Illouz et al. (2016)</a>. 
						The pathology side of the project included performing neuronal immunostaining for NeuN and GAD67 expression on 12-month old rat brain samples with 40-micron thickness. 
						Daniella then used a light, fluorescence and confocal microscopes to image the stained sections and ImageJ software to process images and quantify the number of 
						cells and stain density within brain regions. This summer work also included other side projects and tasks that contributed to other work being done in the lab.
						The other branches of this project included sectioning the rat brains into 40-micron layers and performing Laser Capture 
						Microdissection to collect samples of blood vessels in the brain for RNA isolation.
						<br><br>
						Deliverables for this work included a poster presentation to a panel of judges and SRI employees. </p>
