						<p>At the University of Saint Michael's College (USMC), Daniella has participated in numerous leadership 
							positions ranging from moderating panels with professors and alumni to organizing, planning and running events. 
							Daniella has been part of the first-year Orientation-Week staff for the past 4 years. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, 
							Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Leader</b></i>, with responsabilities including: leading a group of 15-30 incoming 
							students and orienting them to university life, promoting orientation events to the group of students online and in-person,
							running a social media page for the group, hosting campus tours, and helping the rest of the staff where necessary. 
							At the end of Orientation-Week 2021, Daniella was awarded <b><i>Leader of the Year</b></i>.
							In 2022, Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Marshal</b></i>. This role undertook more responsabilities, including planning, organizing 
							and executing events, among other tasks. Specifically, Daniella helped to organize the Academic Orientation - a branch 
							of the week-long event focused on the students' academics - by contacting professors to attend panels and socials, 
							and moderating said these events.
							<br><br>
							Beyond orientation, Daniella was a part of the <b><i>St. Mike's Mentorship Program</b></i> 
							as a mentor and an Academic Representative in the 2021-2022 academic year. These roles put Daniella as a first point 
							of contact for the mentees of the program. Specifically, Daniella was a mentor to 5 first and second year students, 
							meeting individually and as a group 1-2 times monthly. As an Academic Representative for the Physical Sciences, Daniella 
							aided all mentees with Program of Study specific questions.
							<br><br>
							Further, Daniella has been on several committees at USMC, all of which run through the student union.
							These committees include the <b><i>Formal Event committee</b></i> in spring 2020, the <b><i>Mental Health & Accessibility 
							committee</b></i> in the 2021-2022 academic year, and currently the <b><i>Electoral By-Laws Review committee</b></i> in the 2022-2023 academic year.
							These committees have not only developped skills in group leadership and advocacy for the student body, but also positively 
							contributed to the amelioration and atmosphere of the community at USMC. Daniella also volunteered as a moderator for 
							the St. Mike's Grad Week 2021 alumni panel. 
							In 2022, Daniella received a <b><i>Leadership Award for Outstanding Exhibition of College Spirit and Pride</b></i>.
